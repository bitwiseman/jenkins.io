= Upgrading Jenkins

== Automated Upgrade

The simplest way to upgrade Jenkins is to use the built-in "Automated Upgrade".
If this option will work on your system, it will be available in the Jenkins UI
"Manage Jenkins".

Clicking "Upgrade Automatically", will display an update page. Click the checkbox for
"Restart Jenkins when installation is complete" and Jenkins will restart when the
upgrade completes.

== Package-based upgrade

If the above is not available, you should use the usual upgrade process based on the
platform and method used to install Jenkins.
