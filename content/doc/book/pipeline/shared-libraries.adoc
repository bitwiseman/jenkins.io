= Extending with Shared Libraries

As Pipeline is adopted for more and more projects in an organization, common
patterns are likely to emerge. Oftentimes it is useful to share parts of
Pipelines between various projects to reduce redundancies and keep code
"DRY"
footnoteref:[dry, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don\'t_repeat_yourself].

Pipeline has support for creating "Shared Libraries" which can be defined in
external source control repositories and loaded into existing Pipelines.

== Defining Shared Libraries

An Shared Library is defined with a name, a source code retrieval method such
as by SCM, and optionally a default version.  The name should be a short
identifier as it will be used in scripts.

The version could be anything understood by that SCM; for example, branches,
tags, and commit hashes all work for Git.  You may also declare whether scripts
need to explicitly request that library (detailed below), or if it is present
by default.  Furthermore, if you specify a version in Jenkins configuration,
you can block scripts from selecting a _different_ version.

The best way to specify the SCM is using an SCM plugin which has been
specifically updated to support a new API for checking out an arbitrary named
version (_Modern SCM_ option).  As of this writing, the latest versions of the
Git and Subversion plugins support this mode; others should follow.

If your SCM plugin has not been integrated, you may select _Legacy SCM_ and
pick anything offered.  In this case, you need to include
`${library.yourLibName.version}` somewhere in the configuration of the SCM, so
that during checkout the plugin will expand this variable to select the desired
version.  For example, for Subversion, you can set the _Repository URL_ to
`https://svnserver/project/${library.yourLibName.version}` and then use
versions such as `trunk` or `branches/dev` or `tags/1.0`.

=== Directory structure

The directory structure of a Shared Library repository is as follows:

[source]
----
(root)
+- src                     # Groovy source files
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- Bar.groovy  # for org.foo.Bar class
+- vars
|   +- foo.groovy          # for global 'foo' variable
|   +- foo.txt             # help for 'foo' variable
+- resources               # resource files (external libraries only)
|   +- org
|       +- foo
|           +- bar.json    # static helper data for org.foo.Bar
----

The `src` directory should look like standard Java source directory structure.
This directory is added to the classpath when executing Pipelines.

The `vars` directory hosts scripts that define global variables accessible from
Pipeline.
The basename of each `*.groovy` file should be a Groovy (~ Java) identifier, conventionally `camelCased`.
The matching `*.txt`, if present, can contain documentation, processed through the system’s configured markup formatter
(so may really be HTML, Markdown, etc., though the `txt` extension is required).

The Groovy source files in these directories get the same “CPS transformation”
as in Scripted Pipeline.

A `resources` directory allows the `libraryResource` step to be used from an external library to load associated non-Groovy files.
Currently this feature is not supported for internal libraries.

Other directories under the root are reserved for future enhancements.

=== Global Shared Libraries

There are several places where Shared Libraries can be defined, depending on
the use-case. _Manage Jenkins » Configure System » Global Pipeline Libraries_
as many libraries as necessary can be configured.

image::pipeline/add-global-pipeline-libraries.png["Add a Global Pipeline Library", role=center]

Since these libraries will be globally usable, any Pipeline in the system can
utilize functionality implemented in these libraries.

These libraries are considered "trusted:" they can run any methods in Java,
Groovy, Jenkins internal APIs, Jenkins plugins, or third-party libraries.  This
allows you to define libraries which encapsulate individually unsafe APIs in a
higher-level wrapper safe for use from any Pipeline.  Beware that **anyone able to
push commits to this SCM repository could obtain unlimited access to Jenkins**.
You need the _Overall/RunScripts_ permission to configure these libraries
(normally this will be granted to Jenkins administrators).

=== Folder-level Shared Libraries

Any Folder created can have Shared Libraries associated with it. This mechanism
allows scoping of specific libraries to all the Pipelines inside of the folder
or subfolder.

Folder-based libraries are not considered "trusted:" they run in the Groovy
sandbox just like typical Pipelines.

===  Automatic Shared Libraries

Other plugins may add ways of defining libraries on the fly.
For example, the
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-organization-folder[GitHub Organization Folder]
plugin allows a script to use an untrusted library such as
`github.com/someorg/somerepo` without any additional configuration.  In this
case, the specified GitHub repository would be loaded, from the `master`
branch, using an anonymous checkout.

== Using libraries

Shared Libraries marked _Load implicitly_ allows Pipelines to immediately use
classes or global variables defined by any such libraries. To access other
shared libraries, the `Jenkinsfile` needs to use the `@Library` annotation,
specifying the library's name:

image::pipeline/configure-global-pipeline-library.png["Configuring a Global Pipeline Library", role=center]

[source,groovy]
----
@Library('my-shared-library') _
/* Using a version specifier, such as branch, tag, etc */
@Library('my-shared-library@1.0') _
/* Accessing multiple libraries with one statement */
@Library(['my-shared-library', 'otherlib@abc1234']) _
----

The annotation can be anywhere in the script where an annotation is permitted
by Groovy.  When referring to class libraries (with `src/` directories),
conventionally the annotation goes on an `import` statement:

[source,groovy]
----
@Library('somelib')
import com.mycorp.pipeline.somelib.UsefulClass
----

[TIP]
====
For Shared Libraries which only define Global Variables (`vars/`), or a
`Jenkinsfile` which only needs a Global Variable, the
link:http://groovy-lang.org/objectorientation.html#_annotation[annotation]
pattern `@Library('my-shared-library') _` may be useful for keeping code
concise. In essence, instead of annotating an unnecessary `import` statement,
the symbol `_` is annotated.

It is not recommended to `import` a global variable/function,
since this will force the compiler to interpret fields and methods as `static`
even if they were intended to be instance.
The Groovy compiler in this case can produce confusing error messages.
====

Libraries are resolved and loaded during _compilation_ of the script,
before it starts executing.  This allows the Groovy compiler to understand the
meaning of symbols used in static type checking, and permits them to be used
in type declarations in the script, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
@Library('somelib')
import com.mycorp.pipeline.somelib.Helper

int useSomeLib(Helper helper) {
    helper.prepare()
    return helper.count()
}

echo useSomeLib(new Helper('some text'))
----

Global Variables however, are resolved at runtime.

=== Library versions

The "Default version" for a configured Shared Library is used when "Load
implicitly" is checked, or if a Pipeline references the library only by name,
for example `@Library('my-shared-library') _`. If a "Default version" is *not*
defined, the Pipeline must specify a version, for example
`@Library('my-shared-library@master') _`.

If "Allow default version to be overridden" is enabled in the Shared Library's
configuration, a `@Library` annotation may also override a default version
defined for the library. This also allows a library with "Load implicitly" to
be loaded from a different version if necessary.

=== Retrieval Method

The best way to specify the SCM is using an SCM plugin which has been
specifically updated to support a new API for checking out an arbitrary named
version (**Modern SCM** option). As of this writing, the latest versions of the
Git and Subversion plugins support this mode.

image::pipeline/global-pipeline-library-modern-scm.png["Configuring a 'Modern SCM' for a Pipeline Library", role=center]

==== Legacy SCM

SCM plugins which have not yet been updated to support the newer features
required by Shared Libraries, may still be used via the **Legacy SCM** option.
In this case, include `${library.yourlibrarynamehere.version}` wherever a
branch/tag/ref may be configured for that particular SCM plugin.  This ensures
that during checkout of the library's source code, the SCM plugin will expand
this variable to checkout the appropriate version of the library.

image::pipeline/global-pipeline-library-legacy-scm.png["Configuring a 'Legacy SCM' for a Pipeline Library", role=center]


== Writing libraries

At the base level, any valid
link:http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html[Groovy code]
is okay for use. Different data structures, utility methods, etc, such as:

[source,groovy]
----
// src/org/foo/Point.groovy
package org.foo;

// point in 3D space
class Point {
  float x,y,z;
}
----

=== Accessing steps

Library classes cannot directly call steps such as `sh` or `git`.
They can however implement methods, outside of the scope of an enclosing
class, which in turn invoke Pipeline steps, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
// src/org/foo/Zot.groovy
package org.foo;

def checkOutFrom(repo) {
  git url: "git@github.com:jenkinsci/${repo}"
}
----

Which can then be called from a Scripted Pipeline:

[source,groovy]
----
def z = new org.foo.Zot()
z.checkOutFrom(repo)
----

This approach has limitations; for example, it prevents the declaration of a
superclass.

Alternately, a set of `steps` can be passed explicitly to a library class, in a
constructor, or just one method:

[source,groovy]
----
package org.foo
class Utilities implements Serializable {
  def steps
  Utilities(steps) {this.steps = steps}
  def mvn(args) {
    steps.sh "${steps.tool 'Maven'}/bin/mvn -o ${args}"
  }
}
----

When saving state on classes, such as above, the class *must* implement the
`Serializable` interface. This ensures that a Pipeline using the class, as seen
in the example below, can properly suspend and resume in Jenkins.

[source,groovy]
----
@Library('utils') import org.foo.Utilities
def utils = new Utilities(this)
node {
  utils.mvn 'clean package'
}
----

If the library needs to access global variables, such as `env`, those should be
explicitly passed into the library classes, or methods, in a similar manner.

Instead of passing numerous variables from the Scripted Pipeline into a library,

[source,groovy]
----
package org.foo
class Utilities {
  static def mvn(script, args) {
    script.sh "${script.tool 'Maven'}/bin/mvn -s ${script.env.HOME}/jenkins.xml -o ${args}"
  }
}
----

The above example shows the script being passed in to one `static` method,
invoked from a Scripted Pipeline as follows:

[source,groovy]
----
@Library('utils') import static org.foo.Utilities.*
node {
  mvn this, 'clean package'
}
----


=== Defining global variables

Internally, scripts in the `vars` directory are instantiated on-demand  as
singletons. This allows multiple methods to be defined in a
single `.groovy` file for convenience.  For example:

.var/log.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
def info(message) {
    echo "INFO: ${message}"
}

def warning(message) {
    echo "WARNING: ${message}"
}
----

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
@Library('utils') _

log.info 'Starting'
log.warning 'Nothing to do!'
----

Declarative Pipeline does not allow global variable usage outside of a `script`
directive
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42360[JENKINS-42360]).

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
@Library('utils') _

pipeline {
    agent none
    stage ('Example') {
        steps {
             script { // <1>
                 log.info 'Starting'
                 log.warning 'Nothing to do!'
             }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> `script` directive required to access global variables in Declarative Pipeline.

[NOTE]
====
A variable defined in a shared library will only show up in _Global Variables
Reference_ (under _Pipeline Syntax_) after Jenkins loads and uses that library
as part of a successful Pipeline run.
====

.Avoid preserving state in global variables
[WARNING]
====
Avoid defining global variables with methods that interact or preserve state.
Use a static class or instantiate a local variable of a class instead.

The example below shows a global variable `customer` which stores a `name` value.
It also outputs a message when name is set.

.var/customer.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
def setName(value) {
    privateName = value
    echo "Setting name to ${privateName}"
}
def getName() {
    privateName
}
----

====

=== Defining custom steps

Shared Libraries can also define global variables which behave similarly to
built-in steps, such as `sh` or `git`. Global variables defined in Shared
Libraries *must* be named with all lower-case or "camelCased" in order to be
loaded properly by Pipeline.
footnote:[https://gist.github.com/rtyler/e5e57f075af381fce4ed3ae57aa1f0c2]

For example, to define `sayHello`, the file `vars/sayHello.groovy`
should be created and should implement a `call` method. The `call` method
allows the global variable to be invoked in a manner similar to a step:

[source,groovy]
----
// vars/sayHello.groovy
def call(String name = 'human') {
    // Any valid steps can be called from this code, just like in other
    // Scripted Pipeline
    echo "Hello, ${name}."
}
----

The Pipeline would then be able to reference and invoke this variable:

[source,groovy]
----
sayHello 'Joe'
sayHello() /* invoke with default arguments */
----

If called with a block, the `call` method will receive a
link:http://groovy-lang.org/closures.html[`Closure`].
The type should be defined explicitly to clarify the intent of the step, for
example:

[source,groovy]
----
// vars/windows.groovy
def call(Closure body) {
    node('windows') {
        body()
    }
}
----

The Pipeline can then use this variable like any built-in step which
accepts a block:

[source,groovy]
----
windows {
    bat "cmd /?"
}
----

=== Defining a more structured DSL

If you have a lot of Pipelines that are mostly similar, the global
variable mechanism provides a handy tool to build a higher-level DSL
that captures the similarity. For example, all Jenkins plugins are built and
tested in the same way, so we might write a step named
`buildPlugin`:

[source,groovy]
----
// vars/buildPlugin.groovy
def call(body) {
    // evaluate the body block, and collect configuration into the object
    def config = [:]
    body.resolveStrategy = Closure.DELEGATE_FIRST
    body.delegate = config
    body()

    // now build, based on the configuration provided
    node {
        git url: "https://github.com/jenkinsci/${config.name}-plugin.git"
        sh "mvn install"
        mail to: "...", subject: "${config.name} plugin build", body: "..."
    }
}
----

Assuming the script has either been loaded as a
<<global-shared-libraries,Global Shared Library>> or as a
<<folder-level-shared-libraries, Folder-level Shared Library>>
the resulting `Jenkinsfile` will be dramatically simpler:

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
buildPlugin {
    name = 'git'
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----

=== Using third-party libraries

It is possible to use third-party Java libraries, typically found in
link:http://search.maven.org/[Maven Central],
from *trusted* library code using the `@Grab` annotation.  Refer to the
link:http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/grape.html#_quick_start[Grape documentation]
for details, but simply put:

[source,groovy]
----
@Grab('org.apache.commons:commons-math3:3.4.1')
import org.apache.commons.math3.primes.Primes
void parallelize(int count) {
  if (!Primes.isPrime(count)) {
    error "${count} was not prime"
  }
  // …
}
----

Third-party libraries are cached by default in `~/.groovy/grapes/` on the
Jenkins master.

=== Loading resources

External libraries may load adjunct files from a `resources/` directory using
the `libraryResource` step.  The argument is a relative pathname, akin to Java
resource loading:

[source,groovy]
----
def request = libraryResource 'com/mycorp/pipeline/somelib/request.json'
----

The file is loaded as a string, suitable for passing to certain APIs or saving
to a workspace using `writeFile`.

It is advisable to use an unique package structure so you do not accidentally
conflict with another library.

=== Pretesting library changes

If you notice a mistake in a build using an untrusted library,
simply click the _Replay_ link to try editing one or more of its source files,
and see if the resulting build behaves as expected.
Once you are satisfied with the result, follow the diff link from the build’s status page,
and apply the diff to the library repository and commit.

(Even if the version requested for the library was a branch, rather than a fixed version like a tag,
replayed builds will use the exact same revision as the original build:
library sources will not be checked out again.)

_Replay_ is not currently supported for trusted libraries.
Modifying resource files is also not currently supported during _Replay_.
