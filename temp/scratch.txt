Created an org for this post:
https://github.com/bitwise-jenkins/

Forked JS-Nightwatch.js into this org then did pull requests
from https://github.com/bitwiseman/JS-Nightwatch.js.git into
this repo.

Github org project is happy to treat this org's repos as "origin"
even if they are forks on Github.
